Target: src/views/devdock/DevDockView.vue

Overall: DevDock is now functionally credible for a local developer workbench, but the visual hierarchy is still in a transitional state. The multi-project list is useful and the process panel is the right architecture, yet expanded project rows, nested scroll areas, long command lines, and a cramped process panel create more cognitive load than necessary.

Strengths:
- The split between project scripts and process management matches the user's workflow.
- Running status is visible in both script rows and the process panel.
- The interface uses restrained product UI styling and avoids decorative slop.

Priority Issues:
P1: Nested scroll and expanded project height make the page feel unstable and hard to scan.
P1: Process panel actions are too compressed; title, status, pid, port, and five actions compete in a narrow column.
P2: Long script commands dominate rows and should be progressively disclosed or truncated with better affordance.
P2: Running service URL is present but not yet visually prominent enough for the primary post-start action.
P2: Help and recovery cues remain thin for failed starts, stopped processes, and stale ports.

Detector: clean, no findings.
